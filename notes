Node JS Notes


1-NVM (Node version Manager)
nvm list
nvm uninstall[node version]
nvm use [node version]
nvm alias default [node version]
create .nvmrc and write node version in your project repository. The version should be same as terminal

2-NODE JS under the hood
processor can only understand machine code.
above machine code we have assembly language
above assembly language we have c/c++
compiler converts c/c++ to assembly langauge and assembler convets that into machine code
above c/c++ we have high level langauges like javascript/python
we cannot control hardware directly with javascript/python

3-Javascript Engine (Spider Monkey,v8)
Node uses v8 engine
ECMA script is javascript language specifications that help us to make a standard set of rules

4-Thread Pools
It has four threads by default
We can increase the threads manually as well.
FS in libuv uses these threads.
