Node JS Notes


1-NVM (Node version Manager)
nvm list
nvm uninstall[node version]
nvm use [node version]
nvm alias default [node version]
create .nvmrc and write node version in your project repository. The version should be same as terminal

2-NODE JS under the hood
processor can only understand machine code.
above machine code we have assembly language
above assembly language we have c/c++
compiler converts c/c++ to assembly langauge and assembler convets that into machine code
above c/c++ we have high level langauges like javascript/python
we cannot control hardware directly with javascript/python

3-Javascript Engine (Spider Monkey,v8)
Node uses v8 engine
ECMA script is javascript language specifications that help us to make a standard set of rules

4-Thread Pools
It has four threads by default
We can increase the threads manually as well.
FS in libuv uses these threads.

5-Event Emitter
It is only build in javascript without using any c++.
It is only a design pattern.
It is synchrounusily.
The events are registered in an array and are looped to call the specific one.

6-Buffers
Characters set, every letter is reperesented by a number like unicode,ascii
Character encoding is giving binary numbers to different characters, different sequence of bytes to differebt characters
Buffer get some data and move to some where else.
Buffer has a fixed size and contains only raw binary data.
Buffer has a fixed size, it ignore data larger than its size.
They are nor resizeable.
